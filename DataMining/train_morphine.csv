1,I made soo Many bad decisions on morphine Like my theory that porn should be shot like a nhl game  https://twitter.com/andrewjaye/status/763457040702406657 …
1,@stubpb @CandleWaxStar @VictoriaLIVE wow ! It's not a competition and I'm on more. Out of the strong opioids morphine is one of the weakest
1,@ratchet__kev @ferrrrhobs why ? 2mg morphine ? I assume you sprayed it over him as that's how useful it will be.
0,"@AuntyListen no because codeine, and tramadol are weak and depends on morphine dose. I'm on a lot more and not drowsy so personal."
0,@embasic @painfreeED I would liked to have seen 0.1-0.15mg /kg morphine compared to 0.3-0.4mg/kg ketamine.
0,@Gas_Craic @ketaminh @SacchettiAlfred @painfreeED eg for renal colic I would try 1gm IV paracetamol + 400mg PO ibuprofen before IV morphine.
0,"@BodenLab so what is the set order, I've gone codeine, dhc, tramadol morphine, fentanyl oxycodone, tapentadol oxycodone ?"
0,@mlg1611 @1stResponseMini which is where fentanyl/ ketamine come in to play. I don't think morphine is the ideal opioid for pre hospital use
0,@Obidoc no I don't hence asked if you have any connections. Wouldn't you rather use IN diamorphine/ fent or buccal fen or iv morphine first
0,@amit_pawa I was always taught that oxycodone = 1.5-2X stronger than equivalent morphine dose so surprised by James's reply!
0,"@Obidoc wow, I saw a study that showed 600mcg = 10mg IV morphine. I suppose you can just remove lozenge if too much or analgesia reached"
0,@mitchpage3 @painfreeED absolutely ! Now I have IV paracetamol I give them a lot less. Usually 1gm IV paracetamol and 10mg oral morphine
0,@ketaminh @addictedtosmacc @MDaware @DitchDoc14 0.1mg/kg over 5 mins is what I do. I dropped a systolic by 40 after 3mg morphine.
0,"@___JS2 that's a really high dose, hope it stops your pain!! I'm also on oxycodone, so much better than morphine :) x"
0,"@mitchpage3 @painfreeED I'd say a third need nothing post IV paracetamol, for moderate pain it's 60mg codeine and severe IV morphine"
0,@wmassamgrimson I'm finding IVP more an adjunct and In severe pain using morphine first personally. Still few seem to give 10+ from CD book.
0,"@OneLongPlait agreed, paracetamol PO or IV would be my first choice with morphine if needed I.e #NOF."
0,@ketaminh I'd like to have seen a higher dose of morphine used.
0,@perkleberry with regards to repeat dosing - do you not get patients who need relatively large doses i.e 15 mg IV morphine or near 0.15kg ?
0,"@CamWilliams4 I just don't personally think that was likely, but I wasn't there etc. Could a bag of fluids and morphine in 2mg blouses"
0,"@OrganisedPauper My utter sympathy, I was under the pain clinic at 17 and on morphine before 18 so know what it's like. Hope she's okay."
0,"@ali1m @ketaminh @Sleepy_Suz I agree, and would in hospital too. But do you discharge patients home on oral morphine? How many do you supply"
